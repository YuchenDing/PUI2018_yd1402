### Clarity
The graph is for sure easy to read. However, the information you're trying to convey is ambiguous. Please correctly put labels
on your x-axis and y-axis so that your audience can get a better understanding of what information your plot is trying to convey. Also, set grid to true can also make your plot more clear.
### Esthetic
The color and method you're utilizing is perfect. I like the color and layout of your plot.
### Honesty
Yes. The plot honestly reproduce the data without deforming it.

Overall, this is a good graph. One thing prevents it goes from good to excellent is the lack of axis labels. Otherwise I like the 
layout and color.
