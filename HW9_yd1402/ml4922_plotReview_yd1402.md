## Your plot is well visualized, I can understand that it shows weekdayâ€™s rides of long tripduration and short tripduration, and apparently short tripduration are more than the long ones. 
## The color you choose for two types is easy to identify the difference, which is good. Besides, your caption describes your plot clearly. The only thing I suggest is the size of the letter of x-label and y-label could be larger.
