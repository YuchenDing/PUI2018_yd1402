**THIS IS A REPRODUCTION OF MY QUESTION. YOU DID NOT COME UP WITH YOUR OWN IDEA AND A NULL HYPOTHESIS THAT APPLIES TO IT** 

**If you want point for the third part of the exercise you need to redo this first part and come up with an idea of your own**


**Idea** what is your idea? you never said what it is so I cannot assess if the Null Hypothesis is the right one for your idea. All I can say is what your "theory" should have been for this H0 to be right
_I suspect that women are less likely to bike on recreationally than man. This could manifest in the usage of citibike."



NULLNULL  HYPOTHESISHYPOTHE :
The proportion of women biking on weekends is the same or higher than the proportion of men biking on weekdays

the cell above should be a markdown cell since you did not set it as a markdown cell you see different colors for workds as "is" or "or" that are syntax in python


** missing a description of the data:** 
how many weeks are you using? why is that the right (a sufficiently large) sample? is it robust to outliers? for example specific events (festivals, sport event) may skew this proportion on a given date. 

Are you using data from multiple months to suppress seasonal variations?
