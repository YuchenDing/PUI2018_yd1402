### I looked into the repository PUI2018_spj237
  The Null Hypothesis he/she chose is "The proportion of customers biking on weekends is the same or lower than the proportion of subscribers biking on weekends"
  ## 1. Your null and alternative hypothesis are both right. The idea of choosing customers and subscribers is interesting.
  ## 2. The data supports the project you chose. It works out well.
  ## 3. You use proportion as a variable, which is numerical data. Through the plot of your data distribution, we can see that it does not fit Gaussian Curve. Therefore, it is safer to use non-parametric test. 
 ## "When comparing more than two sets of numerical data, a multiple group comparison test such as one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis test should be used first. If they return a statistically significant p value (usually meaning p < 0.05) then only they should be followed by a post hoc test to determine between exactly which two data sets the difference lies. Repeatedly applying the t test or its non-parametric counterpart, the Mann-Whitney U test, to a multiple group situation increases the possibility of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis." --from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3116565/

 ## Kruskal-Wallis test is my recommendation
